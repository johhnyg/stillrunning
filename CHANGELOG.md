# Changelog

## Unreleased — August 18, 2026 (Session 122)

**GitHub Action + CI hardening**

### Added
- **GitHub Action** (`johhnyg/stillrunning@v1`) — CI/CD supply chain scanning via
  `action.yml` + `scan.py`. Scans `requirements.txt` (default) and/or
  `package.json`/`package-lock.json`, fails the build on DANGEROUS packages
  (optionally SUSPICIOUS with `fail-on-suspicious: true`). Outputs: `status`,
  `dangerous-count`, `suspicious-count`, `report`. Optional `token` input enables
  AI scanning of unknown packages.

  ```yaml
  - uses: johhnyg/stillrunning@v1
    with:
      requirements: requirements.txt
  ```

- **ASCII security block banner** — `scan.py` renders a bold red shield banner
  ("SUPPLY-CHAIN SECURITY BLOCK") when malicious packages are detected, so blocks
  are unmissable in CI logs.

### Fixed
- **pip/npm shim subcommand handling** — the wrappers hardcoded `install`
  regardless of the command actually run, breaking `pip download` entirely and
  rewriting `npm i` / `npm add` semantics. Both shims now capture the original
  subcommand and pass it through.

## v2.13.3 — June 12, 2026

**Telemetry heartbeats actually reach the server**

### Fixed
- **Anonymous heartbeats were silently 403'd.** stillrunning.io sits behind
  Cloudflare, which blocks the default `Python-urllib/x.y` User-Agent. The
  heartbeat client sent no User-Agent, so every `install`/`active`/`intercept`/`cli`
  heartbeat was rejected and the exception swallowed — no agent telemetry had ever
  landed. All three request sites (`_send_heartbeat`, `send_intercept_event`,
  `send_cli_ping`) now send `User-Agent: stillrunning/{version}`. Verified: a clean
  container install now lands a heartbeat (HTTP 200).

## v2.13.2 — June 11, 2026

**npm scanning actually works**

### Fixed
- **`stillrunning scan --npm`** — the npm wrapper called `scan <pkg> --npm`, but the
  flag never existed; combined with `set -e` the wrapper failed closed and blocked
  EVERY npm install. scan now checks the npm registry (scoped `@org/pkg` names
  supported), the npm section of the threat feed, and passes `ecosystem=npm` to the
  check-package API.
- **Hardcoded blocklist normalization** — dash-named entries (`pino-debugger`,
  `dev-log-core`, ...) could never match because only the input was normalized to
  underscores. Both sides normalize now.
- **`axios` delegated to the threat feed** — covered by MAL-2026-2307 (malicious
  0.30.4/1.14.1) with proper withdrawal lifecycle instead of a permanent hardcode.

### Added
- **`@anthropic-ai/*` trusted-scope skip** in the npm wrapper template.

## v2.11.0 — May 2, 2026

**Single source of truth + bypass route coverage**

### Added
- **features.json** — version, tiers, verify_checks, last_session in one file
- **`/api/version`** — serves features.json with 5-minute cache
- **scripts/sync-version.py** — syncs version to pyproject.toml and cli.py
- **scripts/regen-readme.py** — regenerates tier table from features.json
- **Venv auto-enable** — shell-install now installs sitecustomize.py automatically
- **Conda hook** — conda_hook.sh wraps `conda install/create`

### Security
- **Closes CVE-2026-31431 gaps #1 (venv) and #5 (conda)**

---

## v2.10.0 — May 2, 2026

**CVE-2026-31431 gap fixes — shell auto-activation**

### Added
- **`stillrunning shell-install`** — auto-activate hooks on shell init (bash/zsh/profile)
- **`stillrunning shell-uninstall`** — remove shell hooks
- **`stillrunning status`** — show status of all protection layers
- **Wrapper scripts** — `~/.stillrunning/bin/pip`, `pip3`, `npm` intercept installs
- **Idempotent rc updates** — reinstall won't duplicate lines in shell config

### Security
- **Closes CVE-2026-31431 audit gap #4** — hooks now activate without manual `source activate.sh`

---

## v2.9.0 — April 25, 2026

**Customer experience polish + CLI standardization**

### Added
- **pricing.py** — single source of truth for all tier pricing
- **Welcome email idempotency** — Stripe webhook retries no longer send duplicate emails
- **Telegram wizard** — `/dash/{subdomain}/telegram` for in-dashboard bot setup
- **Resend-welcome endpoint** — admin can resend welcome emails via API

### Changed
- All pricing references now use `pricing.py` (landing, /pricing, emails)
- Welcome emails now use `alerts@stillrunning.io` From header

### Breaking
- **Exit codes standardized** across all CLI tools:
  - 0 = CLEAN, 1 = ERROR, 2 = USAGE
  - 10 = BLOCKED, 11 = SUSPICIOUS, 12 = RATE_LIMITED, 13 = WITHDRAWN

---

## v2.8.0 — April 25, 2026

**Async scan endpoint + version-aware AI cache**

### Added
- **Async scan endpoint** — `POST /api/scan/async` returns immediately with job_id, poll `/api/scan/status/{job_id}` for results
- **Version-aware AI cache** — cache key is now `(package_name, version)` instead of just `package_name`
- **cache_clear_older_than(days)** — maintenance function to purge old cache entries
- **resolve_latest_version()** — resolves "latest" to actual version from PyPI/npm

### Changed
- Async jobs auto-expire after 1 hour (TTL)
- Legacy cache entries marked `version="unknown"` for re-review on next check

### Breaking
- **Exit codes standardized** across the stillrunning family:
  - 0 = CLEAN (operation succeeded, no threats)
  - 1 = Generic error (network failure, internal bug)
  - 2 = Usage error (bad arguments, missing file)
  - 10 = BLOCKED (confirmed malicious package)
  - 11 = SUSPICIOUS (AI flagged, not confirmed)
  - 12 = RATE_LIMITED (free tier exhausted)
- CI pipelines that assumed exit 1 = block must update to check for exit 10

---

## v2.7.0 — April 25, 2026

**Source tracking + curated blocklist**

### Added
- **Source tracking** — each blocked package shows advisory source (OSV, GitHub, NVD, etc.)
- **Advisory ID linking** — direct links to original security advisories
- **Curated blocklist** — 200,000+ packages from 8 threat intelligence sources

### Changed
- `/security-advisories` page shows source metadata badges
- Blocklist entries include `source` and `advisory_id` fields

---

## v2.6.0 — April 24, 2026

**Fix OSV.dev integration — now ingests ~220,000 malicious packages**

### Fixed
- **OSV.dev API query was broken** — malformed `/v1/query` call returned 0 results
- Now uses bulk GCS download (`osv-vulnerabilities.storage.googleapis.com`) instead

### Added
- **osv_bulk.py** — server-side bulk ingestion of MAL-* advisories
- **222,873 malicious packages** now blocked (10,962 PyPI + 211,911 npm)
- Nightly cron refresh at 03:00 UTC

### Changed
- Blocklist lookup remains O(1) (dict-based, not list)
- Blocklist served from `/api/blocklist` — package size unchanged (76KB wheel)

### Followups (v2.7.0)
- Version-range blocking (currently blocks all versions via `["any"]`)

---

## v2.5.0 — April 24, 2026

**Completeness release — all deferred items from v2.4.0 shipped**

### Added
- **Virtual environment interception** via sitecustomize.py (survives `source .venv/bin/activate`)
- **`stillrunning venv-install`** command to enable venv persistence
- **`stillrunning venv-uninstall`** command to cleanly remove venv integration
- **Debug logging infrastructure** — set STILLRUNNING_DEBUG=1 for verbose output

### Changed
- **Exception handlers audited** — critical handlers now log to debug instead of silent pass
- **VERSION constant** bumped to 2.5.0 in cli.py

### Internal
- **stillrunning/venv_hook.py** — lightweight hook for sitecustomize.py integration
- **12 new tests** for venv persistence and logging infrastructure
- **40 total tests** passing

### Deferred
- A2 (cache version-aware): Requires dashboard.py changes — documented in v2.6.0-followups.md
- A5 (async scan endpoint): Requires dashboard.py changes — documented in v2.6.0-followups.md
- F (GitHub Action): Separate repo — documented in v2.6.0-followups.md
- A4 (exception audit): ~20 handlers updated, remaining documented for future work

---

## v2.4.0 — April 24, 2026

**Refinement release — closes HIGH-severity gaps from product audit**

### Added
- **Manifest parsing** for requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Pipfile, package.json, environment.yml, pixi.toml
- **Interception for poetry, pdm, pipenv, conda, pixi, bun, pnpm** — all major package managers now covered
- **`stillrunning scan-manifest`** CLI command — check all packages in a manifest file before install
- **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** now scans each package (previously bypassed entirely)

### Fixed
- **Hardcoded /root/my-app/.env path** in hook.py — now uses XDG-compliant ~/.stillrunning directory
- **Editable installs** (`pip install -e .`) no longer erroneously blocked or flagged
- **Git/URL dependencies** correctly skipped (can't be checked, shouldn't block)

### Internal
- **stillrunning/manifest.py** — shared manifest parser for all package managers
- **28 new tests** covering manifest parsing, package manager support, and intercept behavior
- **MANAGER_ECOSYSTEM mapping** — proper ecosystem detection for all package managers

---

## v2.3.0 — April 24, 2026

**Critical correctness fixes**

- **Fix:** `/api/check-package` now checks blocklist (was returning UNKNOWN for blocked packages)
- **Fix:** `stillrunning scan <package>` command now works (was documented but not implemented)
- **Fix:** `uv pip install` and `uv add` are now intercepted (previously silent bypass)
- **Fix:** Namespace packages (`azure.storage.blob`) now checked against blocklist
- **Security:** All four fixes address cases where the tool appeared to work but didn't protect users

---

## v2.1.0 — April 19, 2026

**Anonymous telemetry (opt-in)**

- **Heartbeat** — sends anonymous ping to stillrunning.io every 6 hours
- **Setup prompt** — Y/n question after Telegram config
- **Privacy-first** — no email, IP, or log content; just random UUID
- **Disable anytime** — set `telemetry: false` in stillrunning.yaml

**Payload:** machine_id, agent_version, os_type, uptime_hours, process_count

This helps us understand how many agents are actually running. Previously we had 1,500 PyPI downloads but zero visibility into active usage.
